# Planning and Design

## Project Goals

The  primary goal  of the site is to create a seamless and user-friendly reservation experience for customers and staff members. We aim to streamline the process of booking a table, making it intuitive and efficient. Users should be able to easily choose their preferred date and time, enhancing their overall dining experience. The goal is to provide users with a visually appealing and informative interface where they can explore menu items and view descriptions.For administrators, the focus is on creating a powerful reservation management system. This includes tools to view, edit, and update reservations seamlessly.

## User Stories and epics

 I developed this project applying Agile methodology. Even though it's a solo project, I followed Agile principles to learn about flexible development and delivering small improvements over time. The project reflects my commitment to understanding modern software development approaches.
In adopting an Agile development approach, i start  creating epics which were broken down into user stories, each representing a specific feature. I utilized the MoSCoW prioritization (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) to categorize and prioritize each user story based on its importance.

For better planning and estimation, I assigned labels and story points to each user story, considering factors such as time and difficulty. This approach helped me gauge the relative effort required for different tasks and maintain a clear sense of priority. Also every user story includes acceptance criteria and associated tasks.

Presented below is a compilation of completed and closed user stories for this project organized by epics.

 - Epic- Setting up working enviroment
   - As a developer I can **install Django and essential libraries**,
so that I can **quickly set up a robust development environment and kickstart my web projects with confidence**..
   - As a developer, my goal is to **establish a secure environment for managing confidential configuration variables**., so that **sensitive information remains confidential, allowing me to uphold the privacy of critical data within the system**.
   - As a developer I want to **deploy the website on Heroku** so that i can **test its functionality in a live environment and make the completed site accessible to the public**.
